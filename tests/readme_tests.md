1. **`test_data_collection.py`**:
   - Validates the functionality of the `RedditCollector` class to ensure it returns a list and handles empty data gracefully.

2. **`test_data_transformation.py`**:
   - Tests cleaning and normalization functions to verify their outputs are accurate and correctly formatted.

3. **`test_sentiment_analysis.py`**:
   - Tests VADER and Transformer-based sentiment analysis methods to ensure proper detection of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

### Key Points:
- **Setup Method**: The `setUp()` method initializes test data for consistent test execution.
- **Assertions**: Each test uses assertions (`assertEqual`, `assertGreater`, etc.) to validate expected outcomes.
- **Modularity**: Each function in your modules has a corresponding test case for thorough coverage.

These test scripts will ensure the reliability and correctness of the project's core functionality. Let me know if you need additional explanations or extensions!
